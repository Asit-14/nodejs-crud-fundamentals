Node.js CRUD with Express & MongoDB
--------------------------------------------
learning and revising CRUD operations
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.



MAIN SERVER FILE (app.js)

Responsibilities:
- Create Express app
- Load environment variables
- Use JSON middleware
- Connect MongoDB
- Start server

RULE:
- app.listen() should be called ONLY ONCE
- MongoDB should connect BEFORE server starts

MODEL (user.model.js)


Purpose:
- Defines structure of data stored in MongoDB

Fields:
- name (String, required)
- email (String, required, unique)
- address (String, required)

RULE:
- No request or response logic here

CONTROLLER (user.controller.js)


Purpose:
- Handles CRUD operations

Functions:
- createUser     -> POST
- getAllUsers    -> GET
- updateUser     -> PUT
- deleteUser     -> DELETE

RULE:
- Try-catch for every async function
- Controller talks to Model only

ROUTES (user.route.js)

Purpose:
- Map URLs to controller functions

Endpoints:
POST   /api/user/create
GET    /api/user/getallusers
PUT    /api/user/update/:id
DELETE /api/user/delete/:id

RULE:
- No business logic here
- Only route → controller mapping



1. Start server:
   npm run dev

2. CREATE (POST):
   POST http://localhost:8000/api/user/create

3. READ (GET):
   GET http://localhost:8000/api/user/getallusers

4. UPDATE (PUT):
   PUT http://localhost:8000/api/user/update/:id

5. DELETE (DELETE):
   DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/user/delete/:id



CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete

POST   → Create
GET    → Read
PUT    → Update
DELETE → Delete
